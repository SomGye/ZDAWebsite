 * - Home: Welcome to my page!
I am an abstract media creator who loves photography, music, and gaming.

I create abstract oddities with a focus on colors + contrast + textures.

With this and my versatile experience in photo editing and creating glitch art,
I bring strange and unique ideas to life.
 * - Portfolio: I have always loved and appreciated art from afar,
and I spent a long time doodling song lyrics and geometric shapes in school notebooks.
I even explored creating my own glitch art from scratch by using programming
and math to develop the filters and algorithms to overlay effects over my own photography.

Starting in January 2021, I decided to finally try my hand at digital art.
I went from trying out stylus apps like PenUp on my phone to
giving Procreate a shot and deciding to throw out the 'rulebook' of usual art.

Since then, I have developed my focus of *colors + contrast + textures* and experimentation to always deliver something unique and interesting.
I hope you enjoy my work!
 * - Commissions: I am here to create abstract art for you, with 4 available tiers to meet your budget and design needs.
