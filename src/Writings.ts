        I wish I thought

        I had it all
        Only in mind
        Nothing to recall
        
        Nothing at all
        Matters in these halls

        Bitter and sour
        Always in mind
        Dour the tone,
        Grim the reflection
        
        Nothing at all
        Really matters
        Too much, to recall.

Days of wishing

        For me, this can be incredibly disabling/dehabilitating.
        There is no cure for allergies, only treatment, 
        and even those have severe limitations.

        When allergies hit hard, I am unable to participate in society,
        unable to breathe, eat, move, or even really think. 
        They close my airways, overheat my body, overload my immune
        system, and rob me of any energy or strength.
        Prescriptions and meds only help to alleviate the baseline and 
        try to act as a preventative, and can help reduce harm, but
        once a full-blown allergy attack hits, there is nothing you
        can do except try not to make it worse, and rest. 
        I have tried experimental treatments and shots, but they
        did nothing. From what I can tell, the medical field has
        made no advances in decades on this.

        And yet, society as a whole treats allergies as mere "sniffles"
        and an inconvenience to them. People get annoyed if you show any
        signs, and are frightened of coughs. And yet, they refuse to
        do anything to help, and society at large refuses to look into
        a cure or real, proper treatment to fully alleviate symptoms.
        We are just expected to suffer.
